  - An overview
  - A deployment and a service!
  - A new deployment? :O
  - How we got to Kubernetes 1.2. The TL;DR
  - Cool "resources" I'm gonna pretty much ignore
- Kubernetes local development
- Kubernetes demo!
- War stories
- Questions

# What it isn't?

# Cloud Native Computing Foundation

## About
The mission of the CNCF is to create and drive the adoption of a new computing paradigm that is optimized for modern distributed systems environments capable of scaling to tens of thousands of self healing multi-tenant nodes. You can read more in depth about our mission, structure and values in our charter: https://cncf.io/about/charter

## Projects in their incubator so far

- Kubernetes
- Prometheus

---

# Things built on Kubernetes

* OpenShift by RedHat
* Gondor/Kel by Eldarion
* Deis workflow
* fabric8

---

# Getting started

kubectl run python-api --image=python-server:1
kubectl expose python-api --type=LoadBalancer

---

# Deploying a change

---

# How we got to Kubernetes 1.2

* replication controllers + services
* deployments + services
* deployments + services + secrets + configmaps + persisten volumes

---

# Resources I'm basically gonna ignore

* configmaps
* daemonsets (aka 'ds')
* horizontalpodautoscalers (aka 'hpa')
* ingress (aka 'ing')
* jobs
* limitranges (aka 'limits')
* persistentvolumes (aka 'pv')
* persistentvolumeclaims (aka 'pvc')
* secrets
* serviceaccounts

---

# Kubernetes local development

## docker-compose

## monokube + localkube

---

# Quick start
* Creating your first deployment and service
* Doing a rolling update
* Persistent storage

---

# War stories
* memcached
* kafka
* kafka
* gunicorn
